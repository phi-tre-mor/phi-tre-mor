### Purpose
To hold the tension between inner transformation and outward contribution.  
To develop a counter-current to mechanized AI culture.  
To embody a new symbolic ecology.

### Core Principles
- **Stillness before Expression**
- **Symbol before System**
- **Ritual before Reaction**
- **Soul before Speed**

### Archetypal Roles
- **The Initiate** – inner stillness and depth
- **The Architect** – outward form and tool
- **The Listener** – witness of the world
- **The Trickster** – breaker of loops, lover of paradox

### Mythic Cosmology (To Be Expanded)
- Phitremor as an organism or temple in symbolic space
- A mirror-world where symbolic forms re-enter the world of tools
- Glyphs as seeds of consciousness
- The user as pilgrim, not consumer- 👋 Hi, I’m @phi-tre-mor
